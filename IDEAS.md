This list is a bunch of ideas to improve Reactirator. 
It can happens that in fact certains ideas are bad and so they will be remove from the list but at least 95% of them have to be implemented at some point.
So this list provides information about work and contributions to do.
Feel free to make a pull request if you want to suggest something.

### List:
- [ ] Feature page => Add external link to each feature (e.g. for typescript item, a link to open typescript website).
- [ ] Feature page => Hover an item display a small help about what is being build to add the feature ? (e.g. for prettier, explain what files are added or modified in the project).
- [ ] Overview page => Add a framework/starter/template type
	- Being able to chose between CRA and next.js / gatsby ?
	- A particular template ? (e.g. with CRA you can do: "npx create-react-app my-app --template [template-name]" )
- [ ] Manager => Display stats about the project like the number of react components.
- [ ] Creator => Change installation block terminal to xterm like in the manager (Currently, we are using two differents method to display the log in a terminal comp. when running a process, and the installation is the old one).
- [ ] Package search => maybe add a modal to add a package instead of current hover (We can re-use the modal dependencies installation component from the manager part).
- [ ] Manager => Can add more informations about a package (author, github info etc.)
- [ ] Npm score: In the modal add a (?) next to the npm score field and when hover it shows the details score.
- [ ] Radio btns group in the component creation, review the design ?
- [ ] Creator => Make the name input mandatory (It is blocking at the end when we click on the creation button but I think it should block at the first step).
- [ ] Creator => Scripts section, Where could it be positionning ? (Its been removed in the last version, the component is still in the codebase, maybe find a place to position it ? And re-make his design).
- [ ] Manager => Add an open in editor button in the main task panel.
- [ ] Creator => Add an open in editor button in the success page.
