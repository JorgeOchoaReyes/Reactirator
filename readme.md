## What is it?

Reactirator is a desktop application built with Electron using TypeScript, React and Node.
It has two parts which can be considered as two differents applications:

#### **The creator:** generate React.js project.

	  <img src="https://i.gyazo.com/21ba6bb674f4c1b0be2a02252572b385.png" width="400" />
  </div>
You will follow an installation process where you can select famous React configurations/features, look for packages, pre-generate folders and components etc.

#### The manager: manage React.js project.

  </div>
  
Basically it is a task runner: start your development server, your tests, build, execute any tasks you have in your scripts section, or modify your project dependencies.
<br>
<br>
Reactirator aims to be very beginner friendly but also to be a real time saver for more confirmed developper : get ride of the configs steps, simply push buttons and focus on your code.
Under the hood the application automatized all of this by running cli commands.
For now the project creation is generated on top of [``create-react-app``](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app) so you don't have to worry about the base project requirements such as bundlers, tests etc. In the future we also want to support frameworks such as Next.js.

## Upcoming features
- A React components generator in the manager part.
- Support for Next.js and other frameworks to determined ?

**More in the [list ideas](https://github.com/Leopold-V/Reactirator/ideas) ! Anyone is free to suggest new features to make Reactirator a better tool.
