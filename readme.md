# React project generator.

Desktop application built with Electron + React.js.

## What is this :

Generate a create-react-app application with your favorites configurations.
Simply fill out a short form with optional tools and wait for the generation.
It includes the choice among well-known react packages and tools.

As a react developper, even if you use create-react-app you may find it boring to chain the 'npm install' for every packages, and some packages need more configurations.

For example you would like to add tailwind and react-router-dom to your CRA project after initialized it. 
You have to init the project then install react-router-dom with another command and for tailwind according to the doc (https://tailwindcss.com/docs/guides/create-react-app) 6-7 more things to do. Isn't it quite boring when you repeat those tasks for each project ?

**With this application you simply need to check cases and click on the create button.**

## What is include in it ?

For now thoses are the packages and tools supported :

- typescript
- prettier
- bootstrap
- Tailwind
- CSS reset
- react-router-dom
- styled-components
- prop-types
